title: "Adult hippocampal neurogenesis in Alzheimer's disease: A roadmap to clinical relevance"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/2023-CellStemCell-SaltaE
excerpt: "Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) drops sharply during early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), via unknown mechanisms, and correlates with cognitive status in AD patients. Understanding AHN regulation in AD could provide a framework for innovative pharmacological interventions. We here combine molecular, behavioral, and clinical data and critically discuss the multicellular complexity of the AHN niche in relation to AD pathophysiology. We further present a roadmap toward a better understanding of the role of AHN in AD by probing the promises and caveats of the latest technological advancements in the field and addressing the conceptual and methodological challenges ahead."
