excerpt: 'microRNA-132 (miR-132), a known neuronal regulator, is one of the most robustly downregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) in the brain of Alzheimers disease (AD) patients. Increasing miR-132 in AD mouse brain ameliorates amyloid and Tau pathologies, and also restores adult hippocampal neurogenesis and memory deficits. However, the functional pleiotropy of miRNAs requires in-depth analysis of the effects of miR-132 supplementation before it can be moved forward for AD therapy. We employ here miR-132 loss- and gain-of-function approaches using single-cell transcriptomics, proteomics, and in silico AGO-CLIP datasets to identify molecular pathways targeted by miR-132 in mouse hippocampus. We find that miR-132 modulation significantly affects the transition of microglia from a disease-associated to a homeostatic cell state. We confirm the regulatory role of miR-132 in shifting microglial cell states using human microglial cultures derived from induced pluripotent stem cells.'
