excerpt: 'The generation of new neurons at the hippocampal neurogenic niche, known as adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), and its impairment, have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). MicroRNA-132 (miR-132), the most consistently downregulated microRNA (miRNA) in AD, was recently identified as a potent regulator of AHN, exerting multilayered proneurogenic effects in adult neural stem cells (NSCs) and their progeny. Supplementing miR-132 in AD mouse brain restores AHN and relevant memory deficits, yet the exact mechanisms involved are still unknown. Here, we identify NACC2 as a novel miR-132 target implicated in both AHN and AD. miR-132 deficiency in mouse hippocampus induces Nacc2 expression and inflammatory signaling in adult NSCs. We show that miR-132-dependent regulation of NACC2 is involved in the initial stages of human NSC differentiation towards astrocytes and neurons. Later, NACC2 function in astrocytic maturation becomes uncoupled from miR-132. We demonstrate that NACC2 is present in reactive astrocytes surrounding amyloid plaques in mouse and human AD hippocampus, and that there is an anticorrelation between miR-132 and NACC2 levels in AD and upon induction of inflammation. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms by which miR-132 regulates neurogenesis and cellular reactivity in AD, will provide valuable insights towards its possible application as a therapeutic target.'
