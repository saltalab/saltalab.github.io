## **Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis & Alzheimer’s Disease**

*Gustav Klimt. The Tree of Life. 1905*

We employ single-cell transcriptomics to profile putatively neurogenic cellular populations in postmortem adult human brain. We want to gain insights into their age, their interaction with other cells within the hippocampal niche microenvironment, and their potential role in Alzheimer’s disease.


## **Multitargeting Approaches in Alzheimer’s Disease**

*Yayoi Kusama. Untitled. 1967*

We study the multilayered effects of microRNAs in Alzheimer’s disease mouse brain and human cellular models, and explore their potential as therapeutic targets.

## **Microbiome & Alzheimer’s Disease**

*Banksy. The caveman. ca 2008*

As part of a larger collaborative network, our aim is to profile the effect of the microbiome in early-life brain imprinting and subsequently its impact on the development of Alzheimer’s disease later on in life.

## **Lifestyle Modification & Neuroinflammation**

*Jackson Pollock. Sea Change. 1947*

We are interested in characterizing the impact of physical exercise on the effectors of neuroinflammation, namely on microglial populations. We use human iPSC-derived microglia-like cells and a battery of omics and other technologies.

## **Brain Aging & Resilience**

*Carmen Herrera. Equilibrio. 2017*

Using a combination of omics technologies we aim to profile the cell type-specific signatures of healthy aging and resilience in the human brain.
